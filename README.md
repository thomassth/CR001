FFmpeg wrapper for podcast publishing

## Problem
1. It is hard to publish podcasts to Youtube, i.e. you need to make a video
2. The least time and resource consuming way is to use FFmpeg to do the convert
3. Barely anyone (I taught) remember how to use FFmpeg, even though it's as simple as Ctrl+C/V
4. I want to learn C# with some goal

## Solution
A GUI wrapping the FFmpeg (not very impressive but it gets the job done)

## Todo
- [ ] Wait for approval on Windows store
- [ ] Allow custom FFmpeg location (In case I didn't update the in built one)
- [ ] Drag n Drop
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Multiplatform?
- [ ] Allow more customization to FFmpeg arguments (Like HandBrake maybe)
